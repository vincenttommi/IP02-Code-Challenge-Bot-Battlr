# As a user, I should be able to:

#  See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
# Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should

#  Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
 #  `YourBotArmy` component.
#  Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
 #  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
 #  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.
